# @channel Thanks for joining today, here is the code from class
# hashes.py 


words = ["apple", "book", "cat", "dog", "egypt", "france"]

# â€‹to access egypt, runtime is: O( n )

## What if we had a magic function

# takes a word ----> returns the index for where that word is located in some array

# book  -> 1

# egypt -> 4

# fake_word -> None

# this function is O(1)


# HASH FUNCTIONS

# Any string input ---> A specific number (within some range)

# MOST IMPORTANT: 

# This function must be deterministic

# Same input will always return the same output


def my_hash(s, limit):

    # take every character in the string, and convert character to number

    # Convert each character into UTF-8 numbers

    string_utf = s.encode()


    total = 0

    for char in string_utf:

        total += char

        total &= 0xffffffff # limit total to 32 bits

    return total % limit

hash_table = [None] * 8 

# ADD items to hash_table using the my_hash function

# Hash the key to get an index

# Store the value at the generated Index

index = my_hash('Hello', len(hash_table))

hash_table[index] = 'Hello value'

index = my_hash('World', len(hash_table))

hash_table[index] = 'World value'


# # Retrieve some items from hash_table

# # Lets retrieve the value for "Hello"

index = my_hash('World', len(hash_table))

print(hash_table[index]) # should be "World Value"

print(hash_table)
